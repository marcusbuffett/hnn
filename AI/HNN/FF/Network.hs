-- 
-- An implementation of feed-forward neural networks in pure Haskell.
-- 
-- It uses weight matrices between each layer to represent the connections between neurons from
-- a layer to the next and exports only the useful bits for a user of the library.
-- 
-- Here is an example of using this module to create a feed-forward neural network with 2 inputs,
-- 2 neurons in a hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer, with random weights, and compute
-- its output for [1,2] using the sigmoid function for activation for all the neurons.
-- 
-- > import AI.HNN.FF.Network
-- > import Numeric.LinearAlgebra
-- >
-- > main = do
-- >   n <- createNetwork 2 [2] 1 :: IO (Network Double)
-- >   print $ output n sigmoid (fromList [1, 1])
-- 
-- /Note/: Here, I create a @Network Double@, but you can replace 'Double' with any number type
-- that implements the appropriate typeclasses you can see in the signatures of this module.
-- Having your number type implement the @Floating@ typeclass too is a good idea, since that's what most of the
-- common activation functions require.
--
-- /Note 2/: You can also give some precise weights to initialize the neural network with, with
-- 'fromWeightMatrices'. You can also restore a neural network you had saved using 'loadNetwork'.
-- 
-- Here is an example of how to train a neural network to learn the XOR function.
-- ( for reference: XOR(0, 0) = 0, XOR(0, 1) = 1, XOR(1, 0) = 1, XOR(1, 1) = 0 )
-- 
-- First, let's import hnn's feedforward neural net module, and hmatrix's vector types.
-- 
-- > import AI.HNN.FF.Network
-- > import Numeric.LinearAlgebra
-- 
-- Now, we will specify our training set (what the net should try to learn).
-- 
-- > samples :: Samples Double
-- > samples = [ fromList [0, 0] --> fromList [0]
-- >           , fromList [0, 1] --> fromList [1]
-- >           , fromList [1, 0] --> fromList [1]
-- >           , fromList [1, 1] --> fromList [0] 
-- >           ]
-- 
-- You can see that this is basically a list of pairs of vectors, the first vector being
-- the input given to the network, the second one being the expected output. Of course,
-- this imply working on a neural network with 2 inputs, and a single neuron on the output layer. Then,
-- let's create one!
-- 
-- > main = do
-- >   net <- createNetwork 2 [2] 1
-- 
-- You may have noticed we haven't specified a signature this time, unlike in the earlier snippet.
-- Since we gave a signature to samples, specifying we're working with 'Double' numbers, and since
-- we are going to tie 'net' and 'samples' by a call to a learning function, GHC will gladly figure out
-- that 'net' is working with 'Double'. 
-- 
-- Now, it's time to train our champion. But first, let's see how bad he is now. The weights are most likely
-- not close to those that will give a good result for simulating XOR. Let's compute the output of the net on
-- the input vectors of our samples, using 'tanh' as the activation function.
-- 
-- >   mapM_ (print . output net tanh . fst) samples
-- 
-- Ok, you've tested this, and it gives terrible results. Let's fix this by letting 'trainNTimes' teach our neural net
-- how to behave. Since we're using 'tanh' as our activation function, we will tell it to the training function,
-- and also specify its derivative.
-- 
-- >   let smartNet = trainNTimes 1000 0.8 tanh tanh' net samples
-- 
-- So, this tiny piece of code will run the backpropagation algorithm on the samples 1000 times, with a learning rate
-- of 0.8. The learning rate is basically how strongly we should modify the weights when we try to correct the error the net makes
-- on our samples. The bigger it is, the more the weights are going to change significantly. Depending on the cases, it is good,
-- but sometimes it can also make the backprop algorithm oscillate around good weight values without actually getting to them.
-- You usually want to test several values and see which ones gets you the nicest neural net, which generalizes well to samples
-- that are not in the training set while giving decent results on the training set.
-- 
-- Now, let's see how that worked out for us:
-- 
-- >   mapM_ (print . output smartNet tanh . fst) samples
-- 
-- You could even save that neural network's weights to a file, so that you don't need to train it again in the future, using 'saveNetwork':
--
-- >   saveNetwork "smartNet.nn" smartNet
--
-- Please note that 'saveNetwork' is just a wrapper around zlib compression + serialization using the binary package.
-- AI.HNN.FF.Network also provides a 'Data.Binary.Binary' instance for 'Network', which means you can also simply use
-- 'Data.Binary.encode' and 'Data.Binary.decode' to have your own saving/restoring routines, or to simply get a bytestring 
-- we can send over the network, for example.
-- 
-- Here's a run of the program we described on my machine (with the timing): first set of
-- fromList's is the output of the initial neural network, the second one is the output of
-- 'smartNet' :-)
-- 
-- > fromList [0.574915179613429]
-- > fromList [0.767589097192215]
-- > fromList [0.7277396607146663]

-- | Generic training function.
-- 
-- The first argument is a predicate that will tell the backpropagation algorithm when to stop.
-- The first argument to the predicate is the epoch, i.e the number of times the backprop has been
-- executed on the samples. The second argument is /the current network/, and the third is the list of samples.
-- You can thus combine these arguments to create your own criterion.
-- 
-- For example, if you want to stop learning either when the network's quadratic error on the samples,
-- using the tanh function, is below 0.01, or after 1000 epochs, whichever comes first, you could
-- use the following predicate:
-- 
-- > pred epochs net samples = if epochs == 1000 then True else quadError tanh net samples < 0.01
-- 
-- You could even use 'Debug.Trace.trace' to print the error, to see how the error evolves while it's learning,
-- or redirect this to a file from your shell in order to generate a pretty graphics and what not.
-- 
-- The second argument (after the predicate) is the learning rate. Then come the activation function you want,
-- its derivative, the initial neural network, and your training set.
-- Note that we provide 'trainNTimes' and 'trainUntilErrorBelow' for common use cases.
